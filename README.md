# Cookie Cats Game A/B Testing

Cookie Cats is a very popular mobile game developed by Tactile Entertainment. This is a classic Connect Three style game where the player has to connect the same colored tiles in order to pass the screen, Something like the game Candy Crush.
As players progress through the game, they encounter obstacles that force them to wait a while before progressing or making in-app purchases. In this project, we will analyze the result of an A/B Test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. Specifically, in this project we want to measure the impact of player retention and game rounds.
