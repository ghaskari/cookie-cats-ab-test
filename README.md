# Cookie Cats Game A/B Testing

## Introduction
Cookie Cats is a popular mobile game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic Connect Three style game where the player has to connect tiles of the same color to pass the level, similar to Candy Crush. As players progress through the game, they face obstacles that may require them to wait before they can progress or make in-app purchases.

## Project Description
In this project, we will analyze the results of an A/B test conducted on Cookie Cats. The A/B test involved moving the first gate in the game from level 30 to level 40. The goal of the project is to measure the impact of this change on player retention and game rounds.

## Analysis
We will use data analysis techniques to compare player behavior before and after the gate move. Specifically, we will compare the number of game rounds played by players and the percentage of players who reached levels beyond the gate. By comparing these metrics between the control group (level 30 gate) and the test group (level 40 gate), we can determine whether the gate move had a significant impact on player behavior.

## Conclusion
By analyzing the results of the A/B test, we can gain insights into how the gate move impacted player retention and game rounds in Cookie Cats. This information can be used to optimize the game and improve the player experience.
